# `/chromium_src`

This directory contains source code that is copied from Chromium and modified to work with Electron.

It contains surface area of Chrome that is not in libchromiumcontent, such as DevTools, spell check, and prerendering. It is built separately from libchromiumcontent.

_Things can break in here when Chrome is upgraded._
