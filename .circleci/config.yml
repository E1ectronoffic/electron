Main Process ModulescontentTracing
contentTracing
Collect tracing data from Chromium to find performance bottlenecks and slow operations.

Process: Main

This module does not include a web interface. To view recorded traces, use trace viewer, available at chrome://tracing in Chrome.

Note: You should not use this module until the ready event of the app module is emitted.

const { app, contentTracing } = require('electron')

app.whenReady().then(() => {
  (async () => {
    await contentTracing.startRecording({
      included_categories: ['*']
    })
    console.log('Tracing started')
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 5000))
    const path = await contentTracing.stopRecording()
    console.log('Tracing data recorded to ' + path)
  })()
})

Methods
The contentTracing module has the following methods:

contentTracing.getCategories()
Returns Promise<string[]> - resolves with an array of category groups once all child processes have acknowledged the getCategories request

Get a set of category groups. The category groups can change as new code paths are reached. See also the list of built-in tracing categories.

NOTE: Electron adds a non-default tracing category called "electron". This category can be used to capture Electron-specific tracing events.

contentTracing.startRecording(options)
options (TraceConfig | TraceCategoriesAndOptions)
Returns Promise<void> - resolved once all child processes have acknowledged the startRecording request.

Start recording on all processes.

Recording begins immediately locally and asynchronously on child processes as soon as they receive the EnableRecording request.

If a recording is already running, the promise will be immediately resolved, as only one trace operation can be in progress at a time.

contentTracing.stopRecording([resultFilePath])
resultFilePath string (optional)
Returns Promise<string> - resolves with a path to a file that contains the traced data once all child processes have acknowledged the stopRecording request

Stop recording on all processes.

Child processes typically cache trace data and only rarely flush and send trace data back to the main process. This helps to minimize the runtime overhead of tracing since sending trace data over IPC can be an expensive operation. So, to end tracing, Chromium asynchronously asks all child processes to flush any pending trace data.

Trace data will be written into resultFilePath. If resultFilePath is empty or not provided, trace data will be written to a temporary file, and the path will be returned in the promise.

contentTracing.getTraceBufferUsage()
Returns Promise<Object> - Resolves with an object containing the value and percentage of trace buffer maximum usage

value number
percentage number
Get the maximum usage across processes of trace buffer as a percentage of the full state.

+## Benchmarks
+<img src="http://static.dragonflydb.io/repo-assets/aws-throughput.svg" width="80%" border="0"/>
+Dragonfly is crossing 3.8M QPS on c6gn.16xlarge reaching x25 increase in throughput compared to Redis.
+99th latency percentile of Dragonfly at its peak throughput:
+| op  |r6g | c6gn | c7g |
+|-----|-----|------|----|
+| set |0.8ms  | 1ms | 1ms   |
+| get | 0.9ms | 0.9ms |0.8ms |
+|setex| 0.9ms | 1.1ms | 1.3ms
+*All benchmarks were performed using `memtier_benchmark`  (see below) with number of threads tuned per server type and the instance type. `memtier` was running on a separate c6gn.16xlarge machine. For setex benchmark we used expiry-range of 500, so it would survive the end of the test.*
+```bash
+  memtier_berk --ratio ... -t <threads> -c 30 -n 200000 --distinct-client-seed -d 256 \
+     --expiry-range=.
+When running in pipeline mode `--pipeline=30`, Dragonfly reaches **10M qps** for SET and **15M qps** for GET operations.
+### Memcached / Dragonfly
+We compared memcached with Dragonfly on `c6gn.16xlarge` instance on AWS.
+As you can see below Dragonfly dominates memcached for both write and read workloads
+in terms of throughput with a comparable latency. For write workloads, Dragonfly has also better latency, due to contention on the [write path in memcached](docs/memcached_benchmark.md).
+#### SET benchmark
+| Server    | QPS(thousands qps) | latency 99% | 99.9%   |
+|:---------:|:------------------:|:-----------:|:-------:|
+| Dragonfly |  🟩 3844           |🟩 0.9ms     | 🟩 2.4ms |
+| Memcached |   806              |   1.6ms     | 3.2ms    |
+#### GET benchmark
+| Server    | QPS(thousands qps) | latency 99% | 99.9%   |
+|-----------|:------------------:|:-----------:|:-------:|
+| Dragonfly | 🟩 3717            |   1ms       | 2.4ms   |
+| Memcached |   2100             |  🟩 0.34ms  | 🟩 0.6ms |
+Memcached exhibited lower latency for the read benchmark, but also lower throughput.
+### Memory efficiency
+In the following test, we filled Dragonfly and Redis with ~5GB of data
+using `debug populate 5000000 key 1024` command. Then we started sending the update traffic with `memtier` and kicked off the snapshotting with the
+"bgsave" command. The following figure demonstrates clearly how both servers behave in terms of memory efficiency.
+<img src="http://static.dragonflydb.io/repo-assets/bgsave-memusage.svg" width="70%" border="0"/>
+Dragonfly was 30% more memory efficient than Redis in the idle state.
+It also did not show any visible memory increase during the snapshot phase.
+Meanwhile, Redis reached almost x3 memory increase at peak compared to Dragonfly.
+Dragonfly also finished the snapshot much faster, just a few seconds after it started.
+For more info about memory efficiency in Dragonfly see [dashtable doc](/docs/dashtable.md)
+## Running the server
+Dragonfly runs on Linux. We advise running it on Linux version 5.11 or later
+but you can also run Dragonfly on older kernels as well.
+### With docker:
+```bash
+docker run --network=host --ulimit memlock=-1 docker.dragonflydb.io/dragonflydb/dragonfly
+redis-cli PING  # redis-cli can be installed with "apt install -y redis-tools"
+```
+*You need `--ulimit memlock=-1` because some Linux distros configure the default memlock limit for containers as 64m and Dragonfly requires more.*
+### Releases
+We maintain [binary releases](https://github.com/dragonflydb/dragonfly/releases) for x86 and arm64 architectures. You will need to install `libunwind8` lib to run the binaries.
+### Building from source
+See [building from source](./docs/build-from-source.md) for details.
+## Configuration
+Dragonfly supports common Redis arguments where applicable.
+For example, you can run: `dragonfly --requirepass=foo --bind localhost`.
+Dragonfly currently supports the following Redis-specific arguments:
+ * `port` redis connection port, default: 6379
+ * `bind` localhost to only allow locahost connections, Public IP ADDRESS , to allow connections **to that ip** address (aka from outside too)
+ * `requirepass` password for AUTH authentication, default: ""
+ * `maxmemory` Limit on maximum-memory (in human-readble bytes) that is used by the database. 0 - means the program will automatically determine its maximum memory usage. default: 0
+ * `dir` - by default, dragonfly docker uses `/data` folder for snapshotting. the CLI uses: ""
+    You can use `-v` docker option to map it to your host folder.
+ * `dbfilename` the filename to save/load the DB. default: "dump";
+In addition, it has Dragonfly specific arguments options:
+ * `memcache_port`  - to enable memcached compatible API on this port. Disabled by default.
+ * `keys_output_limit` - maximum number of returned keys in `keys` command. Default is 8192.
+   `keys` is a dangerous command. We truncate its result to avoid blowup in memory when fetching too many keys.
+ * `dbnum` - maximum number of supported databases for `select`.
+ * `cache_mode` - see [Cache](#novel-cache-design) section below.
+ * `hz` - key expiry evaluation frequency. Default is 100. Lower frequency uses less cpu when
+   idle at the expense of slower eviction rate.
+ * `save_schedule` - glob spec for the UTC time to save a snapshot which matches HH:MM (24h time). default: ""
+ * `keys_output_limit` -  Maximum number of keys output by keys command. default: 8192
+for more options like logs management or tls support, run `dragonfly --help`.
+## Roadmap and status
+Currently, Dragonfly supports ~185 Redis commands and all memcache commands besides `cas`.
+We are almost on par with Redis 5 API. Our next milestone will be to stabilize basic
+functionality and implement the replication API.
+If you see that a command you need, is not implemented yet, please open an issue.
+For dragonfly-native replication, we are designing a distributed log format that will support order of magnitude higher speeds.
+After the replication feature we will continue with other Redis missing commands from
+APIs 3-6.
+Please see [API readiness doc](docs/api_status.md) for the current status of Dragonfly.
+## Design decisions
+### Novel cache design
+Dragonfly has a single unified adaptive caching algorithm that is very simple and memory efficient.
+You can enable caching mode by passing `--cache_mode=true` flag. Once this mode
+is on, Dragonfly will evict items least likely to be stumbled upon in the future but only when
+it is near maxmemory limit.
+### Expiration deadlines with relative accuracy
+Expiration ranges are limited to ~4 years. Moreover, expiration deadlines
+with millisecond precision (PEXPIRE/PSETEX etc) will be rounded to closest second
+**for deadlines greater than 134217727ms (approximately 37 hours)**.
+Such rounding has less than 0.001% error which I hope is acceptable for large ranges.
+If it breaks your use-cases - talk to me or open an issue and explain your case.
+For more detailed differences between this and Redis implementations [see here](docs/differences.md).
+### Native Http console and Prometheus compatible metrics
+By default, Dragonfly allows http access via its main TCP port (6379). That's right, you
+can connect to Dragonfly via Redis protocol and via HTTP protocol - the server recognizes
+the protocol  automatically during the connection initiation. Go ahead and try it with your browser.
+Right now it does not have much info but in the future, we are planning to add there useful
+debugging and management info. If you go to `:6379/metrics` url you will see some prometheus
+compatible metrics.
+The Prometheus exported metrics are compatible with the Grafana dashboard [see here](tools/local/monitoring/grafana/provisioning/dashboards/dashboard.json).
+Important! The http console is meant to be accessed within a safe network.
+If you expose Dragonfly's TCP port externally, it is advised to disable the console
+with `--http_admin_console=false` or `--nohttp_admin_console`.
+## Background
+Dragonfly started as an experiment to see how an in-memory datastore could look like if it was designed in 2022. Based on  lessons learned from our experience as users of memory stores and as engineers who worked for cloud companies, we knew that we need to preserve two key properties for Dragonfly: a) to provide atomicity guarantees for all its operations, and b) to guarantee low, sub-millisecond latency over very high throughput.
+Our first challenge was how to fully utilize CPU, memory, and i/o resources using servers that are available today in public clouds. To solve this, we used [shared-nothing architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shared-nothing_architecture), which allows us to partition the keyspace of the memory store between threads so that each thread would manage its own slice of dictionary data. We call these slices - shards. The library that powers thread and I/O management for shared-nothing architecture is open-sourced [here](https://github.com/romange/helio).
+To provide atomicity guarantees for multi-key operations, we used the advancements from recent academic research. We chose the paper ["VLL: a lock manager redesign for main memory database systems”](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~abadi/papers/vldbj-vll.pdf) to develop the transactional framework for Dragonfly. The choice of shared-nothing architecture and VLL allowed us to compose atomic multi-key operations without using mutexes or spinlocks. This was a major milestone for our PoC and its performance stood out from other commercial and open-source solutions.
+Our second challenge was to engineer more efficient data structures for the new store. To achieve this goal, we based our core hashtable structure on paper ["Dash: Scalable Hashing on Persistent Memory"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.07302.pdf). The paper itself is centered around the persistent memory domain and is not directly related to main-memory stores.
+Nevertheless, it's very much applicable to our problem. It suggested a hashtable design that allowed us to maintain two special properties that are present in the Redis dictionary: a) its incremental hashing ability during datastore growth b) its ability to traverse the dictionary under changes using a stateless scan operation. Besides these 2 properties,
+Dash is much more efficient in CPU and memory. By leveraging Dash's design, we were able to innovate further with the following features:
+ * Efficient record expiry for TTL records.
+ * A novel cache eviction algorithm that achieves higher hit rates than other caching strategies like LRU and LFU with **zero memory overhead**.
+ * A novel **fork-less** snapshotting algorithm.
+After we built the foundation for Dragonfly and [we were happy with its performance](#benchmarks),
+we went on to implement the Redis and Memcached functionality. By now, we have implemented ~185 Redis commands (roughly equivalent to Redis 5.0 API) and 13 Memcached commands.
+And finally, <br>
+<em>Our mission is to build a well-designed, ultra-fast, cost-efficient in-memory datastore for cloud workloads that takes advantage of the latest hardware advancements. We intend to address the pain points of current solutions while preserving their product APIs and propositions.

++"USE OF CHECK IMAGES AND SUBSTITUTE CHECKS For each original check that you deposit, you hereby authorize us (and any collecting bank, returning bank, Reserve Bank or processor that subsequently receives the original check) to create an electronic image ("check image") of the original check and to process that check image for collection, payment and return. You further authorize the destruction of the original check that has been imaged. We may in our sole discretion determine the manner in which to collect or return a check image. We may (i) present or transfer the check image to the paying bank, a Federal Reserve Bank, a check clearing house, image exchange network or Other collecting bank or returning bank; or (ii) create a substitute check and collect such substitute check (governed by the Check Collection for the 21 st Century Act referred to here as the "Check 21 Act") instead of the check image. A check image or a substitute check may be collected through one or more check clearinghouses, through one or more Federal Reserve Banks, or pursuant to an exchange agreement with another depository institution. In such cases, you agree that the check image or substitute check is subject to the rules of that clearinghouse, Federal Reserve Bank or exchange agreement. You agree that we may debit your Account for any of the following items: (i) a check image of an original check drawn on your Account and presented for payment or collection, or (ii) a returned check image of an original check that was deposited by you. In these situations, we may debit your Account wÅthout receipt of, or review of, the original check associated with the check image. In our sole discretion, we may return to a presenting bank, returning bank or paying bank, or post to your Account, a paper copy or paper representation of an original check (including without limitation an image replacement document or IRD, or a photocopy) drawn on or returned to your Account that does not otherwise meet the technical or legal requirements for a substitute check. You agree that a check image that is received or created by the Bank in the check deposit, collection or return process shall be considered a "check" and/or an "item" for all purposes under this Agreement and applicable law. In addition, a check that you deposit with us, or that you draw on your Account, may be truncated in the check collection process and replaced with a substitute check. You authorize us to pay, process or return a substitute check in the same manner as "check" or "item" under this Agreement. Substitute checks are governed under the Check 21 Act and the terms of this Agreement, to the extent not modified by the Check 21 Act."

++"PNCBANK FUNDS AVAILABILITY POLICY FOR BUSINESS ACCOUNTS"																																					
++"Effective June 26, 2020 Introducing Our Funds Availability Policy When you deposit checks and similar items to your PNC Bank account, you expect us to make the funds available for your use as quickly as possible. Our Funds Availability Policy is designed to do just that. Depending on the type of non-cash deposit you make, your funds may be available as quickly as the next business day. Of course, depending on the amount, type and source of your non-cash deposit, there are situations when your deposit will take longer to become available for your use."																																					
++"Our Funds Availability Policy provides detailed information about when funds you deposit will become available for your use. This policy is in effect for accounts opened in all PNC Bank markets. Please take a moment to review this Policy. By understanding how we make your deposits of non-cash items available, it will be easier for you to manage your account and realize all the benefits of banking with PNC Bank. Determining Availability of a Deposit We determine availability by counting the number of business days from the business day of your deposit. Every day except Saturday, Sunday and a federal holiday is a business day. If a deposit is received through one of our branch tellers, ATM, mobile device, remote deposit scanner, electronic deposit (i.e. ACH, Zelle@, Real-Time Payments), or by mail before our cut-off time, we will consider that day to be the day of your deposit. However, if a deposit is received after our cut-off time or on a day that is not a business day, we will consider the deposit as being received on the next business day that we are open. With the exception of deposits made at non-PNC ATMs, our cut-off time is 10:00 p.m. ET. The cut-off time for deposits made at non-PNC Bank ATMs is 3:00 p.m. ET. Further, deposits made through our night depository after 6:00 a.m. ET may be processed on the next business day. Availability varies depending on the type of deposit and is explained below. Checks drawn on banks located outside of the United States are not subject to this availability Policy. Please inquire regarding availability at the time you make such Initial $100 of Your Deposit The initial $100 of any deposit will be available on the evening of your deposit to pay checks or items that are presented to us that evening for posting. The balance of the $100, if any, will be available on the first business day after the business day of your deposit for all purposes.

++Your account was overdrawn and may require immediate attention.																																					
++Here’s what happened: On April 26, 2022, your account was overdrawn. A total of 1 transaction(s) were returned unpaid. See below																																					
++for the transaction details. Your account may be subject to a fee each time we pay a transaction or decline a																																					
++payment due to insufficient funds.																																					
++Total charges for 1 items $36																																					
++The total charges for 1 items paid into overdraft and/or returned unpaid due to insufficient funds is $36.00.																																					
++Please adjust your records by the amount of this charge.																																					
++NOTE: The maximum number of paid or returned items PNC will charge on a business day is 4. The remainder																																					
++of the items, if any, will be paid or returned with no charge.																																					
++Here’s what you need to																																					
++do immediately:																																					
++Check your balance and, if needed, make a deposit so there is enough money to bring your account above $0																																					
++and cover any declined payments as well as transactions you made that have not yet been deducted from your																																					
++account. Remember to include ACH transactions, online bill payments and debit card activity that have not yet																																					
++been deducted from your account, in addition to checks you wrote that haven't yet been cashed. The quickest																																					
++way to make a deposit is to transfer money online, by phone, by PNC ATM, or bring cash to your local PNC																																					
++branch.																																					
++It is important to make a deposit as soon as possible.																																					
++#barcode																																					
++Here’s why it happened: Even though you deposit and withdraw money throughout the day, we don't finalize these transactions until																																					
++the end of the day. At the end of each business day, we add the money that went into your account before																																					
++subtracting the money that went out of it. If that results in a negative available balance, your account is																																					
++overdrawn.																																					
++Here are your current																																					
++account settings:																																					
++Overdraft Protection has not been established for this account. Please contact us if you would like to set																																					
++up this service.																																					
++Overdraft Coverage: Your account is currently Opted In. You or your joint owner may revoke your																																					
++opt-in or opt-out choice at any time. To learn more about PNC Overdraft Solutions, visit us online at																																					
++pnc.com/overdraftsolutions. To manage both your Overdraft Coverage and Overdraft Protection																																					
++settings, call 1-877-588-3605, visit any branch, or sign on to PNC Online Banking, and select the

+"USE OF CHECK IMAGES AND SUBSTITUTE CHECKS For each original check that you deposit, you hereby authorize us (and any collecting bank, returning bank, Reserve Bank or processor that subsequently receives the original check) to create an electronic image ("check image") of the original check and to process that check image for collection, payment and return. You further authorize the destruction of the original check that has been imaged. We may in our sole discretion determine the manner in which to collect or return a check image. We may (i) present or transfer the check image to the paying bank, a Federal Reserve Bank, a check clearing house, image exchange network or Other collecting bank or returning bank; or (ii) create a substitute check and collect such substitute check (governed by the Check Collection for the 21 st Century Act referred to here as the "Check 21 Act") instead of the check image. A check image or a substitute check may be collected through one or more check clearinghouses, through one or more Federal Reserve Banks, or pursuant to an exchange agreement with another depository institution. In such cases, you agree that the check image or substitute check is subject to the rules of that clearinghouse, Federal Reserve Bank or exchange agreement. You agree that we may debit your Account for any of the following items: (i) a check image of an original check drawn on your Account and presented for payment or collection, or (ii) a returned check image of an original check that was deposited by you. In these situations, we may debit your Account wÅthout receipt of, or review of, the original check associated with the check image. In our sole discretion, we may return to a presenting bank, returning bank or paying bank, or post to your Account, a paper copy or paper representation of an original check (including without limitation an image replacement document or IRD, or a photocopy) drawn on or returned to your Account that does not otherwise meet the technical or legal requirements for a substitute check. You agree that a check image that is received or created by the Bank in the check deposit, collection or return process shall be considered a "check" and/or an "item" for all purposes under this Agreement and applicable law. In addition, a check that you deposit with us, or that you draw on your Account, may be truncated in the check collection process and replaced with a substitute check. You authorize us to pay, process or return a substitute check in the same manner as "check" or "item" under this Agreement. Substitute checks are governed under the Check 21 Act and the terms of this Agreement, to the extent not modified by the Check 21 Act."

+"PNCBANK FUNDS AVAILABILITY POLICY FOR BUSINESS ACCOUNTS"																																					
+"Effective June 26, 2020 Introducing Our Funds Availability Policy When you deposit checks and similar items to your PNC Bank account, you expect us to make the funds available for your use as quickly as possible. Our Funds Availability Policy is designed to do just that. Depending on the type of non-cash deposit you make, your funds may be available as quickly as the next business day. Of course, depending on the amount, type and source of your non-cash deposit, there are situations when your deposit will take longer to become available for your use."																																					
+"Our Funds Availability Policy provides detailed information about when funds you deposit will become available for your use. This policy is in effect for accounts opened in all PNC Bank markets. Please take a moment to review this Policy. By understanding how we make your deposits of non-cash items available, it will be easier for you to manage your account and realize all the benefits of banking with PNC Bank. Determining Availability of a Deposit We determine availability by counting the number of business days from the business day of your deposit. Every day except Saturday, Sunday and a federal holiday is a business day. If a deposit is received through one of our branch tellers, ATM, mobile device, remote deposit scanner, electronic deposit (i.e. ACH, Zelle@, Real-Time Payments), or by mail before our cut-off time, we will consider that day to be the day of your deposit. However, if a deposit is received after our cut-off time or on a day that is not a business day, we will consider the deposit as being received on the next business day that we are open. With the exception of deposits made at non-PNC ATMs, our cut-off time is 10:00 p.m. ET. The cut-off time for deposits made at non-PNC Bank ATMs is 3:00 p.m. ET. Further, deposits made through our night depository after 6:00 a.m. ET may be processed on the next business day. Availability varies depending on the type of deposit and is explained below. Checks drawn on banks located outside of the United States are not subject to this availability Policy. Please inquire regarding availability at the time you make such Initial $100 of Your Deposit The initial $100 of any deposit will be available on the evening of your deposit to pay checks or items that are presented to us that evening for posting. The balance of the $100, if any, will be available on the first business day after the business day of your deposit for all purposes.

+Your account was overdrawn and may require immediate attention.																																					
+Here’s what happened: On April 26, 2022, your account was overdrawn. A total of 1 transaction(s) were returned unpaid. See below																																					
+for the transaction details. Your account may be subject to a fee each time we pay a transaction or decline a																																					
+payment due to insufficient funds.																																					
+Total charges for 1 items $36																																					
+The total charges for 1 items paid into overdraft and/or returned unpaid due to insufficient funds is $36.00.																																					
+Please adjust your records by the amount of this charge.																																					
+NOTE: The maximum number of paid or returned items PNC will charge on a business day is 4. The remainder																																					
+of the items, if any, will be paid or returned with no charge.																																					
+Here’s what you need to																																					
+do immediately:																																					
+Check your balance and, if needed, make a deposit so there is enough money to bring your account above $0																																					
+and cover any declined payments as well as transactions you made that have not yet been deducted from your																																					
+account. Remember to include ACH transactions, online bill payments and debit card activity that have not yet																																					
+been deducted from your account, in addition to checks you wrote that haven't yet been cashed. The quickest																																					
+way to make a deposit is to transfer money online, by phone, by PNC ATM, or bring cash to your local PNC																																					
+branch.																																					
+It is important to make a deposit as soon as possible.																																					
+#barcode																																					
+Here’s why it happened: Even though you deposit and withdraw money throughout the day, we don't finalize these transactions until																																					
+the end of the day. At the end of each business day, we add the money that went into your account before																																					
+subtracting the money that went out of it. If that results in a negative available balance, your account is																																					
+overdrawn.																																					
+Here are your current																																					
+account settings:																																					
+Overdraft Protection has not been established for this account. Please contact us if you would like to set																																					
+up this service.																																					
+Overdraft Coverage: Your account is currently Opted In. You or your joint owner may revoke your																																					
+opt-in or opt-out choice at any time. To learn more about PNC Overdraft Solutions, visit us online at																																					
+pnc.com/overdraftsolutions. To manage both your Overdraft Coverage and Overdraft Protection																																					
+settings, call 1-877-588-3605, visit any branch, or sign on to PNC Online Banking, and select the

Main Process ModulescontentTracing
contentTracing
Collect tracing data from Chromium to find performance bottlenecks and slow operations.

Process: Main

This module does not include a web interface. To view recorded traces, use trace viewer, available at chrome://tracing in Chrome.

Note: You should not use this module until the ready event of the app module is emitted.

const { app, contentTracing } = require('electron')

app.whenReady().then(() => {
  (async () => {
    await contentTracing.startRecording({
      included_categories: ['*']
    })
    console.log('Tracing started')
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 5000))
    const path = await contentTracing.stopRecording()
    console.log('Tracing data recorded to ' + path)
  })()
})

Methods
The contentTracing module has the following methods:

contentTracing.getCategories()
Returns Promise<string[]> - resolves with an array of category groups once all child processes have acknowledged the getCategories request

Get a set of category groups. The category groups can change as new code paths are reached. See also the list of built-in tracing categories.

NOTE: Electron adds a non-default tracing category called "electron". This category can be used to capture Electron-specific tracing events.

contentTracing.startRecording(options)
options (TraceConfig | TraceCategoriesAndOptions)
Returns Promise<void> - resolved once all child processes have acknowledged the startRecording request.

Start recording on all processes.

Recording begins immediately locally and asynchronously on child processes as soon as they receive the EnableRecording request.

If a recording is already running, the promise will be immediately resolved, as only one trace operation can be in progress at a time.

contentTracing.stopRecording([resultFilePath])
resultFilePath string (optional)
Returns Promise<string> - resolves with a path to a file that contains the traced data once all child processes have acknowledged the stopRecording request

Stop recording on all processes.

Child processes typically cache trace data and only rarely flush and send trace data back to the main process. This helps to minimize the runtime overhead of tracing since sending trace data over IPC can be an expensive operation. So, to end tracing, Chromium asynchronously asks all child processes to flush any pending trace data.

Trace data will be written into resultFilePath. If resultFilePath is empty or not provided, trace data will be written to a temporary file, and the path will be returned in the promise.

contentTracing.getTraceBufferUsage()
Returns Promise<Object> - Resolves with an object containing the value and percentage of trace buffer maximum usage

value number
percentage number
Get the maximum usage across processes of trace buffer as a percentage of the full state.
