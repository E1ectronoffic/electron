# Distributing Apps With Electron Forge

## Introduction to Electron Forge

Electron Forge is a complete tool for creating, publishing, and installing modern Electron applications. Electron Forge unifies the existing (and well maintained) build tools for Electron development into a simple, easy to use package so
that anyone can jump right in to Electron development.
This allows developers to take their app from source code to their end users' machines.

## Getting started

The [Electron Forge Docs] contain detailed information that can assist you through the process
of taking your application from source code to your end users' machines.
This process contains several subtasks, including:

* Packaging your application [(package)]
* Generating distributable files for each OS [(make)], and,
* Publishing these files to online platforms to download [(publish)].

We recommend you start with the tutorials on [packaging your application], followed by [publishing and updating your application].

## Getting help

* If you need help with developing your app, our [community Discord server][discord] is a great place to get advice from other Electron app developers.
* If you suspect you're running into a bug with the electron-forge package, please check the [GitHub issue tracker] to see if any existing issues match your problem. If not, feel free to fill out our bug report template and submit a new issue.
