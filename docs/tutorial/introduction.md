# Introduction

Welcome to the Electron documentation!

## What is Electron?

Electron is a framework for building desktop applications using JavaScript,
HTML, and CSS. By embedding [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/) and
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) into its binary, Electron allows you to
maintain one JavaScript codebase and create cross-platform apps that
work on Windows, macOS, and Linux â€” no native development experience
required.

## Prerequisites

These docs operate under the assumption that the reader is familiar with both
Node.js and general web development. If you need to get more comfortable with
either of these areas, we recommend the following resources:

* [Getting started with the Web (MDN)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web)
* [Introduction to Node.js](https://nodejs.dev/learn)

## Running examples with Electron Fiddle

[Electron Fiddle](https://electronjs.org/fiddle) is a sandbox app written and
supported by Electron's maintainers. We highly recommend installing it as a
learning tool to experiment with Electron's APIs or to prototype features during
development.

Fiddle also integrates nicely with our documentation. When browsing through examples
in our tutorials, you'll frequently see an "Open in Electron Fiddle" button underneath
a code block. If you have Fiddle installed, this button will redirect you to a
`fiddle.electronjs.org` web page that will open that example's code in Fiddle itself, no
copy-pasting required.
