Map your QuickBooks contractor payments to 1099 boxes
First select the checkbox for each type of contractor payment you recorded last year. Each payment type corresponds to a box on the IRS forms 1099-NEC or 1099-MISC. (Non-employee compensation and rents are the two most common types.)
Then for each payment type selected, select all the QuickBooks expense accounts you used last year. Need more help with this page?
If you’re not sure which expense accounts you used, you can run a report of all last year’s expenses marked for 1099.
