Subject: Avoid clearing/resetting focus on an already focus event
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

When we set the focus via an accessibility API on an element that
is already focused, we first remove the focus and reset it. This
leads to blur/focusout/focusin events being fired again.

This behavior is different than the one we get when we set focus
programmatically, with a mouse, or a keyboard, on an already
focused element. In order to keep the same experience across all
input modalities, this CL removes the divergent focus behavior
for accessibility APIs.

We tried to remove this code two years ago (CL:3547796) but it
got reverted due to bug:40850837. This time, I made sure to discuss
this issue with the Chrome Android accessibility owners to makeÂ 
sure it's safe to remove. They landed CL:5345750, and then gave
us the green light to land this CL.
