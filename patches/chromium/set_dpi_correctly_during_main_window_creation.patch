Subject: Set dpi_ correctly during main window creation

For some Chrome windows the dpi_ setting cannot be set during window
creation because the window location is not yet known. For other windows
the dpi_ setting _must_ be set during window creation. This change
handles both cases by setting dpi_ if the window size/location is being
specified. This then handles both the task manager and main window
cases.
