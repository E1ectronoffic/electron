Subject: fix: handle no top level aura window in WebContentsImpl

https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/4794133
added two new RenderWidgetHostDelegate methods to set and get the
window show state on Aura. However, the implementation of these methods
doesn't take into account the case where there is no top level Aura
Window which leads to a bad access crash trying to get its show state.

This fixes that by guarding against the missing window - this check
can potentially be upstreamed but it's likely that the better fix for this
is to update our OSR code which is several years outdated.
