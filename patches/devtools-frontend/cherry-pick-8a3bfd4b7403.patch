Subject: [PATCH] Add support of the Worklet target

This is in preparation for the back-end to report regular renderer
based worklets (such as CSS / Animation / Audio) as worklets rather
than workers. A sepratate target type from workers is needed since
unlike workers, these lack support for multiple domains, including
Network and Target.
