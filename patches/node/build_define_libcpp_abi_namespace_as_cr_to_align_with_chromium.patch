Subject: build: define _LIBCPP_ABI_NAMESPACE as Cr to align with chromium

Without this define native modules will be built trying to link to _LIBCPP_ABI_NAMESPACE which is the default name, chromium overrides this to Cr for PDB size reasons but they override it on all platforms.  Setting this define allows native modules to actually work. This should not be upstreamed as it is Electron specific.
