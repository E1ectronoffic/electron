Subject: build: pull in a fixed compiler for Windows on Arm

Due to a code-generation defect in the version of Clang used for the M76
branch related to virtual method thunks, it's necessary to build M76
with a later version of Clang. This change pulls in a corrected version
by setting ELECTRON_BUILDING_WOA=1 or similar in the environment.

This PR is only intended to be a temporary workaround and will be
removed when Electron's Chromium updates to a compiler unaffected by
this issue.
