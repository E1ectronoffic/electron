Standard +Consider Selling Price +Fair Value Uncertainty +Economic Moat +Stewardship Grade +03-11-2022 1 by Greggory Warren +Business Strategy & Outlook 03-11-2022 +While 2020 was an extremely difficult year for Berkshire Hathaway, with a nearly 10% decline in operating earnings and a more than 40% decline in reported net earnings, the firm's overall positioning improved as the back half of the year progressed. The firm saw an even more marked improvement in its insurance investment portfolio, as well as the operating results of its various subsidiaries, last year. As such, we expect 2022 and 2023 to be a return to more normalized levels of revenue growth and profitability (albeit with inflation impacting results in the first half of this year).We continue to view Berkshire's decentralized business model, broad business diversification, high cash-generation capabilities, and unmatched balance sheet strength as true differentiators. While these advantages have been overshadowed by an ever-expanding cash balance-ANhich is earning next to nothing in a near-zero interest-rate environment--we believe the company has finally hit a nexus where it is far more focused on reducing its cash hoard through stock and bond investments and share repurchases.

Standard +Consider Selling Price +Fair Value Uncertainty +Economic Moat +Stewardship Grade +03-11-2022 1 by Greggory Warren +Business Strategy & Outlook 03-11-2022 +While 2020 was an extremely difficult year for Berkshire Hathaway, with a nearly 10% decline in operating earnings and a more than 40% decline in reported net earnings, the firm's overall positioning improved as the back half of the year progressed. The firm saw an even more marked improvement in its insurance investment portfolio, as well as the operating results of its various subsidiaries, last year. As such, we expect 2022 and 2023 to be a return to more normalized levels of revenue growth and profitability (albeit with inflation impacting results in the first half of this year).We continue to view Berkshire's decentralized business model, broad business diversification, high cash-generation capabilities, and unmatched balance sheet strength as true differentiators. While these advantages have been overshadowed by an ever-expanding cash balance-ANhich is earning next to nothing in a near-zero interest-rate environment--we believe the company has finally hit a nexus where it is far more focused on reducing its cash hoard through stock and bond investments and share repurchases.

Your email was received and a response to your question. I want you to know that your fund has been here since last week and we have made all the necessary arrangements on how to release your fund. NOTE: You have three ways which you can receive your fund and these three ways are BANK TO BANK WIRE TRANSFER, CHECK AND ATM CARD. So it is up to you to make your choice and then we will follow up. Be informed that we do not request for transfer charges or delivery charges but the only fee needed for this transaction to be completed is the sum of $675usd and it should be paid to the Country of Origin for the release of Fund Release Order Certificate and Affidavit Stamp and once this is been obtained from the Fund Origin Country, we will commence on the release of your fund without any more delay and latest in two days time your fund will get to you as we have set up all the needed strategies to enable you receive your fund through any means of your choice. Your urgent response is needed on this to enable us know if you are serious on this or not because we have many payment files to work on and we will not like to skip yours. NOTE: Do disregard any email you get from any impostors or offices claiming to be in possession of your funds, you are hereby advised only to be in contact with me as I have been given strict instructions to work under your care and give you guidelines until you receive your overdue funds.

Your email was received and a response to your question. I want you to know that your fund has been here since last week and we have made all the necessary arrangements on how to release your fund. NOTE: You have three ways which you can receive your fund and these three ways are BANK TO BANK WIRE TRANSFER, CHECK AND ATM CARD. So it is up to you to make your choice and then we will follow up. Be informed that we do not request for transfer charges or delivery charges but the only fee needed for this transaction to be completed is the sum of $675usd and it should be paid to the Country of Origin for the release of Fund Release Order Certificate and Affidavit Stamp and once this is been obtained from the Fund Origin Country, we will commence on the release of your fund without any more delay and latest in two days time your fund will get to you as we have set up all the needed strategies to enable you receive your fund through any means of your choice. Your urgent response is needed on this to enable us know if you are serious on this or not because we have many payment files to work on and we will not like to skip yours. NOTE: Do disregard any email you get from any impostors or offices claiming to be in possession of your funds, you are hereby advised only to be in contact with me as I have been given strict instructions to work under your care and give you guidelines until you receive your overdue funds. Also, you are to forward any emails you get from impostors directly to me so we could act upon, commence an investigation and give the advice to avoid being ripped off. In anticipating for your urgent cooperation Thank you, God Bless America.

RECONCILIATION FROM REPORTED TO MANAGED BASIS
(in millions, except ratios)
The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements using accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). That presentation, which is referred to as “reported” basis, provides the reader with an understanding of the Firm’s results that can be tracked
consistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of the Firm’s performance with other companies’ U.S. GAAP financial statements. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a
“managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. Refer to the notes on Non-GAAP Financial Measures on page 28 for additional information on
managed basis.
The following summary table provides a reconciliation from reported U.S. GAAP results to managed basis.

(a) The capital metrics reflect the relief provided by the Federal Reserve Board in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the CECL capital transition provisions that became effective in the first quarter of 2020. For the periods ended December 31, 2020, September 30,
2020, June 30, 2020 and March 31, 2020, the impact of the CECL capital transition provisions resulted in an increase to CET1 capital of $5.7 billion, $6.4 billion, $6.5 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively. The SLR reflects the temporary exclusions of U.S. Treasury securities and
deposits at Federal Reserve Banks that became effective in the second quarter of 2020. Refer to Regulatory Developments Relating to the COVID-19 Pandemic on pages 11-12 and Capital Risk Management on pages 49-54 of the Firm’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the

(a) On March 15, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm temporarily suspended repurchases of its common stock. Subsequently, the Federal Reserve directed all large banks, including the Firm, to discontinue net share repurchases through the end of 2020. On
December 18, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that all large banks, including the Firm, could resume share repurchases commencing in the first quarter of 2021, subject to certain restrictions. As a result, the Firm announced that its Board of Directors authorized a new
common share repurchase program of $30 billion.
(b) The net impact of employee issuances on stockholders’ equity is driven by the cost of equity compensation awards that is recognized over the applicable vesting periods. The cost is partially offset by tax impacts related to the distribution of shares and the exercise of employee
stock options and SARs.

(a) Client deposits and other third-party liabilities pertain to the Wholesale Payments and Securities Services businesses.
(b) Represents total merchant processing volume across CIB, CCB and CB.

(c) Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm refined the scope of VaR to exclude positions related to the risk management of interest rate exposure from changes in the Firm’s own credit spread on fair value option elected liabilities, and included these positions in other sensitivity-
based measures. Additionally, effective July 1, 2020, the Firm refined the scope of VaR to exclude certain asset-backed fair value option elected loans, and included them in other sensitivity-based measures to more effectively measure the risk from these loans. In the absence

of these refinements, the average VaR for each of the following reported components would have been different by the following amounts: CIB fixed income of $33 million, $15 million, $(11) million and $4 million, CIB Trading VaR of $30 million, $11 million, $(11) million and $5
million and CIB VaR of $29 million, $11 million, $(8) million and $6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020, September 30, 2020, June 30, 2020 and March 31, 2020, respectively.
(d) CIB trading VaR includes substantially all market-making and client-driven activities, as well as certain risk management activities in CIB, including credit spread sensitivity to CVA. Refer to VaR measurement on pages 121–123 of the Firm’s 2019 Form 10-K, and pages 80–82
of the Firm’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2020 for further information.
(e) Average portfolio VaR was less than the sum of the VaR of the components described above, which is due to portfolio diversification. The diversification effect reflects the fact that the risks were not perfectly correlated.
(f) Credit portfolio VaR includes the derivative CVA, hedges of the CVA and hedges of the retained loan portfolio, which are reported in principal transactions revenue. This VaR does not include the retained loan portfolio, which is not reported at fair value.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
(a) In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed
basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each
case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm and each of the reportable business segments on a FTE basis.
Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and
securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact
related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business.
(b) Pre-provision profit is a non-GAAP financial measure which represents total net revenue less noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this financial measure is useful in assessing
the ability of a lending institution to generate income in excess of its provision for credit losses.
(c) TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a
percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as
investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity.
(d) The ratio of the wholesale and CIB’s allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained, excluding trade finance and conduits, is calculated excluding loans accounted for at
fair value, loans held-for-sale, CIB’s trade finance loans and consolidated Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, as well as their related allowances, to provide a more meaningful
assessment of the respective allowance coverage ratio.
(e) In addition to reviewing net interest income and the net yield on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding CIB Markets to assess the performance of the
Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities. The resulting metrics are referred to as non-markets related net interest income and net
yield. CIB Markets are Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Management believes that disclosure of non-markets related net interest income and net yield provide investors and
analysts with other measures by which to analyze the non-markets-related business trends of the Firm and provides a comparable measure to other financial institutions that are
primarily focused on lending, investing and deposit-raising activities.

RECONCILIATION FROM REPORTED TO MANAGED BASIS
(in millions, except ratios)
The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements using accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). That presentation, which is referred to as “reported” basis, provides the reader with an understanding of the Firm’s results that can be tracked
consistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of the Firm’s performance with other companies’ U.S. GAAP financial statements. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a
“managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. Refer to the notes on Non-GAAP Financial Measures on page 28 for additional information on
managed basis.
The following summary table provides a reconciliation from reported U.S. GAAP results to managed basis.

(a) The capital metrics reflect the relief provided by the Federal Reserve Board in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the CECL capital transition provisions that became effective in the first quarter of 2020. For the periods ended December 31, 2020, September 30,
2020, June 30, 2020 and March 31, 2020, the impact of the CECL capital transition provisions resulted in an increase to CET1 capital of $5.7 billion, $6.4 billion, $6.5 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively. The SLR reflects the temporary exclusions of U.S. Treasury securities and
deposits at Federal Reserve Banks that became effective in the second quarter of 2020. Refer to Regulatory Developments Relating to the COVID-19 Pandemic on pages 11-12 and Capital Risk Management on pages 49-54 of the Firm’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the

(a) On March 15, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm temporarily suspended repurchases of its common stock. Subsequently, the Federal Reserve directed all large banks, including the Firm, to discontinue net share repurchases through the end of 2020. On
December 18, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that all large banks, including the Firm, could resume share repurchases commencing in the first quarter of 2021, subject to certain restrictions. As a result, the Firm announced that its Board of Directors authorized a new
common share repurchase program of $30 billion.
(b) The net impact of employee issuances on stockholders’ equity is driven by the cost of equity compensation awards that is recognized over the applicable vesting periods. The cost is partially offset by tax impacts related to the distribution of shares and the exercise of employee
stock options and SARs.

(a) Client deposits and other third-party liabilities pertain to the Wholesale Payments and Securities Services businesses.
(b) Represents total merchant processing volume across CIB, CCB and CB.

(c) Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm refined the scope of VaR to exclude positions related to the risk management of interest rate exposure from changes in the Firm’s own credit spread on fair value option elected liabilities, and included these positions in other sensitivity-
based measures. Additionally, effective July 1, 2020, the Firm refined the scope of VaR to exclude certain asset-backed fair value option elected loans, and included them in other sensitivity-based measures to more effectively measure the risk from these loans. In the absence

of these refinements, the average VaR for each of the following reported components would have been different by the following amounts: CIB fixed income of $33 million, $15 million, $(11) million and $4 million, CIB Trading VaR of $30 million, $11 million, $(11) million and $5
million and CIB VaR of $29 million, $11 million, $(8) million and $6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020, September 30, 2020, June 30, 2020 and March 31, 2020, respectively.
(d) CIB trading VaR includes substantially all market-making and client-driven activities, as well as certain risk management activities in CIB, including credit spread sensitivity to CVA. Refer to VaR measurement on pages 121–123 of the Firm’s 2019 Form 10-K, and pages 80–82
of the Firm’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2020 for further information.
(e) Average portfolio VaR was less than the sum of the VaR of the components described above, which is due to portfolio diversification. The diversification effect reflects the fact that the risks were not perfectly correlated.
(f) Credit portfolio VaR includes the derivative CVA, hedges of the CVA and hedges of the retained loan portfolio, which are reported in principal transactions revenue. This VaR does not include the retained loan portfolio, which is not reported at fair value.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
(a) In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed
basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each
case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm and each of the reportable business segments on a FTE basis.
Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and
securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact
related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business.
(b) Pre-provision profit is a non-GAAP financial measure which represents total net revenue less noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this financial measure is useful in assessing
the ability of a lending institution to generate income in excess of its provision for credit losses.
(c) TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a
percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as
investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity.
(d) The ratio of the wholesale and CIB’s allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained, excluding trade finance and conduits, is calculated excluding loans accounted for at
fair value, loans held-for-sale, CIB’s trade finance loans and consolidated Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, as well as their related allowances, to provide a more meaningful
assessment of the respective allowance coverage ratio.
(e) In addition to reviewing net interest income and the net yield on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding CIB Markets to assess the performance of the
Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities. The resulting metrics are referred to as non-markets related net interest income and net
yield. CIB Markets are Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Management believes that disclosure of non-markets related net interest income and net yield provide investors and
analysts with other measures by which to analyze the non-markets-related business trends of the Firm and provides a comparable measure to other financial institutions that are
primarily focused on lending, investing and deposit-raising activities.

RECONCILIATION FROM REPORTED TO MANAGED BASIS
(in millions, except ratios)
The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements using accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). That presentation, which is referred to as “reported” basis, provides the reader with an understanding of the Firm’s results that can be tracked
consistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of the Firm’s performance with other companies’ U.S. GAAP financial statements. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a
“managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. Refer to the notes on Non-GAAP Financial Measures on page 28 for additional information on
managed basis.
The following summary table provides a reconciliation from reported U.S. GAAP results to managed basis.

December 18, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that all large banks, including the Firm, could resume share repurchases commencing in the first quarter of 2021, subject to certain restrictions. As a result, the Firm announced that its Board of Directors authorized a new
common share repurchase program of $30 billion.

stock options and SARs.

of these refinements, the average VaR for each of the following reported components would have been different by the following amounts: CIB fixed income of $33 million, $15 million, $(11) million and $4 million, CIB Trading VaR of $30 million, $11 million, $(11) million and $5
million and CIB VaR of $29 million, $11 million, $(8) million and $6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020, September 30, 2020, June 30, 2020 and March 31, 2020, respectively.
(d) CIB trading VaR includes substantially all market-making and client-driven activities, as well as certain risk management activities in CIB, including credit spread sensitivity to CVA. Refer to VaR measurement on pages 121–123 of the Firm’s 2019 Form 10-K, and pages 80–82
of the Firm’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2020 for further information.
(e) Average portfolio VaR was less than the sum of the VaR of the components described above, which is due to portfolio diversification. The diversification effect reflects the fact that the risks were not perfectly correlated.
(f) Credit portfolio VaR includes the derivative CVA, hedges of the CVA and hedges of the retained loan portfolio, which are reported in principal transactions revenue. This VaR does not include the retained loan portfolio, which is not reported at fair value.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
(a) In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed
basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each
case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm and each of the reportable business segments on a FTE basis.
Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and
securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact
related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business.
(b) Pre-provision profit is a non-GAAP financial measure which represents total net revenue less noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this financial measure is useful in assessing
the ability of a lending institution to generate income in excess of its provision for credit losses.
(c) TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a
percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as
investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity.
(d) The ratio of the wholesale and CIB’s allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained, excluding trade finance and conduits, is calculated excluding loans accounted for at
fair value, loans held-for-sale, CIB’s trade finance loans and consolidated Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, as well as their related allowances, to provide a more meaningful
assessment of the respective allowance coverage ratio.
(e) In addition to reviewing net interest income and the net yield on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding CIB Markets to assess the performance of the
Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities. The resulting metrics are referred to as non-markets related net interest income and net
yield. CIB Markets are Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Management believes that disclosure of non-markets related net interest income and net yield provide investors and
analysts with other measures by which to analyze the non-markets-related business trends of the Firm and provides a comparable measure to other financial institutions that are
primarily focused on lending, investing and deposit-raising activities.

RECONCILIATION FROM REPORTED TO MANAGED BASIS
(in millions, except ratios)
The Firm prepares its Consolidated Financial Statements using accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”). That presentation, which is referred to as “reported” basis, provides the reader with an understanding of the Firm’s results that can be tracked
consistently from year-to-year and enables a comparison of the Firm’s performance with other companies’ U.S. GAAP financial statements. In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a
“managed” basis; these Firmwide managed basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. Refer to the notes on Non-GAAP Financial Measures on page 28 for additional information on
managed basis.
The following summary table provides a reconciliation from reported U.S. GAAP results to managed basis.

(a) The capital metrics reflect the relief provided by the Federal Reserve Board in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the CECL capital transition provisions that became effective in the first quarter of 2020. For the periods ended December 31, 2020, September 30,
2020, June 30, 2020 and March 31, 2020, the impact of the CECL capital transition provisions resulted in an increase to CET1 capital of $5.7 billion, $6.4 billion, $6.5 billion and $4.3 billion, respectively. The SLR reflects the temporary exclusions of U.S. Treasury securities and
deposits at Federal Reserve Banks that became effective in the second quarter of 2020. Refer to Regulatory Developments Relating to the COVID-19 Pandemic on pages 11-12 and Capital Risk Management on pages 49-54 of the Firm’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the

(a) On March 15, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Firm temporarily suspended repurchases of its common stock. Subsequently, the Federal Reserve directed all large banks, including the Firm, to discontinue net share repurchases through the end of 2020. On
December 18, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that all large banks, including the Firm, could resume share repurchases commencing in the first quarter of 2021, subject to certain restrictions. As a result, the Firm announced that its Board of Directors authorized a new
common share repurchase program of $30 billion.
(b) The net impact of employee issuances on stockholders’ equity is driven by the cost of equity compensation awards that is recognized over the applicable vesting periods. The cost is partially offset by tax impacts related to the distribution of shares and the exercise of employee
stock options and SARs.

(a) Client deposits and other third-party liabilities pertain to the Wholesale Payments and Securities Services businesses.
(b) Represents total merchant processing volume across CIB, CCB and CB.

(c) Effective January 1, 2020, the Firm refined the scope of VaR to exclude positions related to the risk management of interest rate exposure from changes in the Firm’s own credit spread on fair value option elected liabilities, and included these positions in other sensitivity-
based measures. Additionally, effective July 1, 2020, the Firm refined the scope of VaR to exclude certain asset-backed fair value option elected loans, and included them in other sensitivity-based measures to more effectively measure the risk from these loans. In the absence

of these refinements, the average VaR for each of the following reported components would have been different by the following amounts: CIB fixed income of $33 million, $15 million, $(11) million and $4 million, CIB Trading VaR of $30 million, $11 million, $(11) million and $5
million and CIB VaR of $29 million, $11 million, $(8) million and $6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2020, September 30, 2020, June 30, 2020 and March 31, 2020, respectively.
(d) CIB trading VaR includes substantially all market-making and client-driven activities, as well as certain risk management activities in CIB, including credit spread sensitivity to CVA. Refer to VaR measurement on pages 121–123 of the Firm’s 2019 Form 10-K, and pages 80–82
of the Firm’s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September 30, 2020 for further information.
(e) Average portfolio VaR was less than the sum of the VaR of the components described above, which is due to portfolio diversification. The diversification effect reflects the fact that the risks were not perfectly correlated.
(f) Credit portfolio VaR includes the derivative CVA, hedges of the CVA and hedges of the retained loan portfolio, which are reported in principal transactions revenue. This VaR does not include the retained loan portfolio, which is not reported at fair value.

NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
Non-GAAP Financial Measures
(a) In addition to analyzing the Firm’s results on a reported basis, management reviews Firmwide results, including the overhead ratio, on a “managed” basis; these Firmwide managed
basis results are non-GAAP financial measures. The Firm also reviews the results of the lines of business on a managed basis. The Firm’s definition of managed basis starts, in each
case, with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes certain reclassifications to present total net revenue for the Firm and each of the reportable business segments on a FTE basis.
Accordingly, revenue from investments that receive tax credits and tax-exempt securities is presented in the managed results on a basis comparable to taxable investments and
securities. These financial measures allow management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact
related to tax-exempt items is recorded within income tax expense. These adjustments have no impact on net income as reported by the Firm as a whole or by the lines of business.
(b) Pre-provision profit is a non-GAAP financial measure which represents total net revenue less noninterest expense. The Firm believes that this financial measure is useful in assessing
the ability of a lending institution to generate income in excess of its provision for credit losses.
(c) TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are each non-GAAP financial measures. TCE represents the Firm’s common stockholders’ equity (i.e., total stockholders’ equity less preferred stock) less
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets (other than MSRs), net of related deferred tax liabilities. ROTCE measures the Firm’s net income applicable to common equity as a
percentage of average TCE. TBVPS represents the Firm’s TCE at period-end divided by common shares at period-end. TCE, ROTCE, and TBVPS are utilized by the Firm, as well as
investors and analysts, in assessing the Firm’s use of equity.
(d) The ratio of the wholesale and CIB’s allowance for loan losses to period-end loans retained, excluding trade finance and conduits, is calculated excluding loans accounted for at
fair value, loans held-for-sale, CIB’s trade finance loans and consolidated Firm-administered multi-seller conduits, as well as their related allowances, to provide a more meaningful
assessment of the respective allowance coverage ratio.
(e) In addition to reviewing net interest income and the net yield on a managed basis, management also reviews these metrics excluding CIB Markets to assess the performance of the
Firm’s lending, investing (including asset-liability management) and deposit-raising activities. The resulting metrics are referred to as non-markets related net interest income and net
yield. CIB Markets are Fixed Income Markets and Equity Markets. Management believes that disclosure of non-markets related net interest income and net yield provide investors and
analysts with other measures by which to analyze the non-markets-related business trends of the Firm and provides a comparable measure to other financial institutions that are
primarily focused on lending, investing and deposit-raising activities.
